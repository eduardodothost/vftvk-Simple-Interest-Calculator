# A Simple Interest Calculators with a Curency Conversion Function.

# [The Calculator on Github Pages](https://eduardodothost.github.io/vftvk-Simple-Interest-Calculator)

- This is a tutorial project I forked as part of IBM's Introduction to Cloud Development with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript course on EDX. 

- I decided to hardcode highlighted text in the compute function by using the innerHTML method to feed  HTML tags and strings directly into the targeted DOM element.

- I also took the liberty of adding a toUSD function in order to return a string with the my currency of choice.
